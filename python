WHAT IS PYTHON?
Python is a high-level, versatile programming language known for its readability and ease of use.
It's widely used in various domains like web development, data science, machine learning, and automation.
Python's syntax is designed to be clear and concise, making it beginner-friendly and efficient for developers.

INPUT and OUTUPUT :
* The input() function asks for user input. it return string value
* The print() statement returns the output

VARIABLE and DATA TYPES:

VARIABLES:
* variables are contianers for storing data values
* each variable represents
    . a data type
    . a value(actual data stored)
* in python we can assign diff values to diff variables in a single line code

DATA TYPES:
* in python primary data types are
    .integer (int) #11
    .float(float) #11.8
    .string(str) #manoj
    .boolean(bool) #True or False

TUPLES:
* tuple is an ordered collection of items
* unlike lists, tuples are immmutable meaning their contents cannot be changed after creation
* tuples are useful for storing data that should not be modified
* for tuples we use regular brackets()

tuple operations:
* to access tuple elements we use index numbers
* we cannot append or remove the elements in a tuple
* we can concatenate two tuples to create a new tuple

LISTS:
* a list is an ordered collection of items
* lists are mutable, meaning their contents can be changed after creation
* lists can store elements of different types (eg: integers, strings, other lists etc)
* for lists we use square brackets[]

list operations:
* we access elements in the list by using indexes
* we can add elements to the list by using append fun {list_name.append(element)}
* we can remove elements in the list by using remove {list_name.remove(index_number)}
* to retrive a part in a list listname[staring_index : ending_index]
* to replace element list_name(index_number)=element
